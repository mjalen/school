For homework, can use any language I want.

## Overview (Numerical Analysis/Methods) 

Goal is to intro, analyze, implement may num. methods.

1. Does it solve the problem?
2. When does it go wrong?
3. Number of operations needed? (Does the method converge at a reasonable time?)
4. Speed.
5. Size of error? (Difficult ?) $exact = apprx + err$. Exact is not given, thus difficult to find error.

Therefore, we typically find the _upper bound_ for error where $0 \leq |err| \leq M$.

6. Is it stable?

## Section 1.1

Notation: $C(X)$ is the set of all _continuous functions_ on the domain $X$. So if $X=[a,b]$ gives $C[a,b]$. $f\inC^n(X)$ means $f, f', \ldots, f^{(n)}$ are continuous on $X$. For $n=\infty$, $f$ is infinitely differentiable.

### IVT

Given $f\in C[a,b]$ and $K\in [f(a),f(b)]$, then $f(c)=K$ for $c\in(a,b)$.

#### Exp

$f(x)=x^3+x-1$ on $[0,1]$. Show $f$ has a root in $[0,1]$.

Clearly $f$ is continuous s.t. $f\in C[0,1]$. $f(0)=-1< 0$ and $f(1)=1 > 0$. Thus, $f$ has a root.

#### Exp

S.t. $x=e^{-x}$ has a sol. Let $f(x) = x - e^{-x}$. Solving for $C[0,1]$ proves like above.

### MVT

Given $f\in f[a,b]$ and $f$ is diff. on $(a,b)$ then there is a number $c\in (a,b)$ s.t

\(f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\)

More specifically, the is a derivative value within $(a,b)$ that is equal to the slope of the line from $a$ to $b$.

### Rolle's Thm

If $f(a)=f(b)$, then there is a extrema $c\in(a,b)$ s.t. $f'(c)=0$.

#### Exp

Show $x^3+x-1=0$ has a uniq. sol. on $[0,1]$.

Suppose $0<c_1<c_2<1$ s.t. $f(c_1)=f(c_2)=0$. By Rolle's thm, there is $c\in(c_1,c_2)$ s.t. $f'(c)=0$. So $3c^2 + 1 = 0$ which is not possible. So $c_1=c_2$.

### Extreme Value THM

Given $f\in C[a,b]$, then $c_1,c_2\in [a,b]$ with $f(c_1)\leq f(x)\leq f(c_2)$. Additionally, if $f\in C'(a,b)$ then $c_1$ (min pt.) and $c_2$ (max pt.) occur at either the end pts $[a,b]$ or the critical pts ($f'=0$).

#### Exp

\(e^{-x}=1 - x + \frac{x^2}{2!} - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n x^n}{n!}\)

To solve this, it must be truncated to find an approx. So, let

\(e^{-x}\approx 1-x\)

Find $\max_{x\in[0,1]} |1-x-e{-x}|$. Let $f(x)=1-x-e^{-x}$ on $[0,1]$. $f\in C[0,1]$ and is once differentiable. 

$f(0)=0$

$f(1)=-e^{-1}$

$f'(x)=-1+e^{-x}=0$ or $x=0$.

Therefore the max is $e^{-1}\approx 0.36$. 

### Taylor THM (p. 9, THM 1.14)

If $f\in C^n [a,b]$ and $f^{(n+1)}$ exists on $(a,b)$ and $x_0\in [a,b]$. Then for any $x\in[a,b]$ there exists a number $x_0 < \xi < x$ with the following.

$f(x)=P_n(x) + R_n(x)$ where 

$P_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{f^{(k)} (x_0)}{k!} (x-x_0)^k = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0) + \ldots$.

This is the n-th Taylor poly for $f$ about $x_0$.

$R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!} (x-x_0)^{n+1}$ is the truncation/error/remainder term.
