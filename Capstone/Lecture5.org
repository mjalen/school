* Requirements Engineering

** Why?

To understand what the client wants. Every employee may understand the project differently, but ultimately the product must be delivered as the client desires.

** Functional Requirements

Typically the system features.

** Nonfunctional Requirements

The different constraints of the system. Security, reliability, etc.

** Scope 

User vs. System requirements. In capstone, user requirements are typically the only one required, as the user is the one ultimately using the system. Common system requirements include middleware functions.

** Process

Iterative. Client explains what they want, we absorb and understand what they want. We implement prototypes, use cases, scenarios, partial implementations, or a description for the client to provide feedback.
