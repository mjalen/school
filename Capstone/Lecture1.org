## Principles of Computing

- Computation

- Coordination
- Recollection
- Automation
- Evaluation
- Design

## Big Picture

Leverage skills and knowledge to anaylze real world problems, with the goal of creating programs. 

## Capstone Project

Our capstone project may not be fully completed, but it is a proof of concept.

Go beyond _CRUD_ (create, replace, update, delete? I believe). Make the project "smarter". The real-world is not always CRUD.

### Project Requirements

1. Must be developed as a team.
2. A sponsor/client is required from commercial, non-profit, or academics.
3. Expected to be more complex than CSCI 4830.

## Teams

- 3/4 members. Self organize. Typically easier when you have worked/have common interests with other people. Large teams (5+) can develop teammate problems.

- Have a well-maintained project task tracker to avoid problem coordination.

### Member Expectations

Each member is expected to pitch in on all documentation, implementation, and testing. But, special roles should be filled:

- Project manager: track schedule, coordinate/assign work.
- Client Liaison: contact w/ sponsor/client.
- Requirements Analyst: Major functional and nonfunctional requirements.
- Architect/Technical lead: makes the major implementation decisions. 
- Quality Assurance/Testing Lead: Put together strategy for testing.
- Lead Researcher: coordinate online/scholary research needs.
- Scribe: record meeting notes.
