# Lecture 2

This class focuses on _good_ decision making. Furthermore, we focus on *decision analysis* models where we play against "nature". Nature is not necessarily an _adversary_, but some decisions have adversaries.

Game theory is playing against an _intelligent_ opponent.

Typically care about decisions of a professional nature.
- ## Elements of Decision
  
  1. Alternatives.
  2. Natural state and outcome.
  3. Incentive/payoffs. What is the utility of a decision ($u\in [0,1]$)
  4. Probabilties of natural state. A probability distribution for each outcome. There does occur times when there is no knowledge of probabilities.
  
  Probabilities are always associated with state of nature. It is easier to determine probability from a problem if you first determine the states.
  
  The probabilities and alternatives can form a matrix/table.
  
  Why do this? It is a method of making our problem specifics clear.
- ## How do we make a desicion?
  
  Decisions can be biased based on the person. The outcomes of decisions can also be inconsistent.
- ## Dominance
- Dominates: Objectively better alternative for each state.
- Weakly dominate: An alternative is better or equal to another alternative in each state.
  
  When dominance exists, you can simply get rid of the lesser alternative. In weak dominance, you _can potentially_ keep the lesser alternative depending on the problem.
  
  State dominance can exist as well.
